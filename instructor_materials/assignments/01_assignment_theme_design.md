## Final Project Design

Design your final project with the idea of conversion for use with a database driven Content Management System. All of your static web page images should look exactly like you want your website pages to look like when the theme is complete.

If you’re using an existing website you’ve created, polish up your design and include any missing pages/templates

1. Create a tag `git tag -l "v0.0.1"`
2. Annotate the tag `git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "v0.0.1"`
3. push the tag `git push origin v.0.0.1`
